# Tasks and Questions

This project focuses on simulating a stochastic SIRD epidemic model using a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) and Gillespie’s algorithm.  
Below is the full list of questions and tasks that must be addressed, corresponding to the instructions from the ISC2 project description.

---

## **1. Transition Probability Matrix for \( N = 3 \)**  
Construct the complete infinitesimal transition probability matrix for the SIRD Markov chain when  
\( N = 3 \).  
This includes deriving the generator matrix \( Q \) and computing the first-order approximation:

$$
P(\Delta t) \approx I + Q \Delta t.
$$

## **2. Simulation of 100 SIRD Trajectories**  
Simulate 100 trajectories of the SIRD process using Gillespie’s algorithm with:

- \( N = 1000 \)  
- Initial state: \( (S(0), I(0), R(0)) = (990, 10, 0) \)  
- Parameters: \( \beta = 0.2, \gamma = 0.1, \nu = 0.001 \)

Record all \( (S, I, R, D) \) values over time.

---

## **3. Epidemic Duration: Mean and Variance**  
For each trajectory, compute the extinction time:

$$
T_{\text{ext}} = \inf \{ t \ge 0 : I(t) = 0 \}.
$$

Then compute:
- The empirical mean \( \hat{T}_{\text{ext}} \)
- The empirical variance

---

## **4. Distribution of \( I(\hat{T}_{\text{ext}}/2) \)**  
At half of the mean extinction time \( \hat{T}_{\text{ext}}/2 \), evaluate the number of infected individuals for each simulation and plot its histogram.

---

## **5. Final Epidemic Size**  
For each trajectory, compute the final epidemic size:

$$
\text{Final Size} = N - S(T_{\text{ext}})
$$

Then compute:
- The empirical mean  
- The empirical variance

---

## **6. Plot 10 Full SIRD Trajectories**  
Plot the compartments \( S(t), I(t), R(t), D(t) \) for at least 10 different simulations on one figure.

---

## **7. Estimation of the Basic Reproduction Number \( R_0 \)**  
Propose and implement a method to estimate \( R_0 \) from real (or simulated) early-phase epidemic data.  
This involves:
- Using early exponential growth of infections
- Estimating the growth rate \( r \)
- Estimating the mean infectious duration
- Combining them to obtain \( R_0 \)

---

## **8. Model Extension: Adding a Latent (Exposed) Class**  
Modify the SIR model by adding an exposed class \( E \), producing a SEIRD model.  
Provide:
- The new CTMC state space
- All transition rates
- The corresponding updated generator matrix \( \tilde{Q} \)
